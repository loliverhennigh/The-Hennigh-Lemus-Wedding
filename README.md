### How to get there?
The best way to get there is to fly into the Cancun International Airpoint. From there it is a one hour and 30 minute drive to Tulum. There are many options for doing this such as Taxis, Buses and Rental Cars. We are getting a rental car and may be able to offer a few rides as well but we encourage you to coordinate with friends.

Bring your bikini and a towel!

### Dress Code
No dress code however dont wear a white dress with blue flowers as this is Lizette's wedding dress

### Presents
Don't bring blenders! We wont have very much room packing so we are not asking for any gifts for the wedding. Your being at the wedding is gift enough alone!
