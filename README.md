## Hennigh-Lemus
You are invited to the **Hennigh-Lemus Wedding!**. Come celebrate with us on **april 28th** at 4:00 pm.

## Location
The wedding will take place in **Tulum, Quintana Roo Mexico.**

### How to get there?
The best way to get to there is to fly into the **Cancun International Airpoint**. Tulum is one hour and 30 minute drive away from the airport. There are many options for doing this such as Taxis, Buses and Rental Cars. We recomend planning with friends and getting a **Rental Car** together.

### What to bring
Tulum is in a tropical rainforest next to the beach so be sure to bring your **bikini, towel, and hot weather clothes.**

### Gifts
We won't have very much room in our luggage so we are asking for **no gifts**. Your presence at our wedding is gift enough!

### Where to stay
There are all kind of hotels in Tulum. If you are looking for something on the beach we recommend [this area](https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/QROO+15,+Quintana+Roo/@20.1832486,-87.4468246,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8f4fd40310e42a4b:0xeedc0db93ff9ab7!2sTulum,+Q.R.!3b1!8m2!3d20.2114185!4d-87.4653502!3m4!1s0x8f4fd13c921463a9:0x15808d818c33a474!8m2!3d20.1832436!4d-87.4446359?dcr=0).
